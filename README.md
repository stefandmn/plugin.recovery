# Recovery Program for Kodi

**Recovery** addon is designed to become the backup and restore tool for **Kodi**
media player within **Clue** environment.
 
This addon was design to run over __Clue__ system but it might work also 
on any _Kodi_ instance (version 17+), using both Python v2 and v3 versions.
The only one dependency is related to `module.clue` which is required through 
the installation process and used for _logging_ channel and _addon_ 
standardized process.

Development, testing and deployment activities are driven by CCM process (Clue 
Configuration Management), built over GNU `make` utility. To see all make rules
try `make help`.

_Enjoy!_
